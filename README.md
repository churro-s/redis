# Redis

An implementation of a subset of [Redis](http://redis.io/) features using Node.js

The coding prompt is in [ServerEngineeringRedisChallenge.pdf](ServerEngineeringRedisChallenge.pdf).

To run:
```js
npm install
node index.js
```

This will create a TELNET server on port 5555, which you can connect to as you would with the Redis CLI.
